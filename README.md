## Notebooks vs Local Development

### Co-lab Notebooks

Advantages:
  + Minimal learning curve
  + High degree of visibility and shareability
  + Effective presentation when code mixed with markdown and data visualizations
  + GPU / TPU processing power

Disadvantages:
  + Can only write and execute Python code
  + Minimal processing power and parallel processing capabilities (excluding GPU / TPU)
  + Relatively low degree of customization
  + Canâ€™t run certain kinds of apps written in frameworks like Flask

### Local Development

Advantages:
  + Can write and execute code written in many different languages and frameworks
  + Greater degree of customization / control
  + Greater privacy (not managed by Google)
  + More processing power and parallel processing capabilities (excluding GPU / TPU)

Disadvantages:
  + Steeper learning curve, likely many tools to learn
  + Not as immediately shareable, unless pushing code to GitHub or a remote server
