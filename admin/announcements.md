## Class 1 Prep

Send this on Friday afternoon the week before the first class:

```
Hey @channel, my name is Mike Rossetti and I'll be your instructor for Unit 3. :wave: Our primary goals for this unit are to transition from notebooks to local development, as well as to ensure our data science efforts are verifiable and reproducible. In the first sprint, we'll focus on getting more comfortable with local development tools as we develop, test, and release our own Python packages. In the second sprint, we'll focus on databases and SQL as an invaluable and foundational skill for any data scientist. Then in the third sprint, we'll build upon the first two sprints by creating our own database-backed web applications and deploying them to remote servers so we can share our data science efforts with the world! Excited? Here we go! :rocket:

To anticipate and reduce the inevitable stress and frustration that may arise next week, you'll want to make sure you are comfortable running local development tools to the greatest extent possible before the first class. Towards this end, I have prepared a detailed "Onboarding Guide" for you to follow: https://github.com/s2t2/lambda-ds-3-1/blob/master/ONBOARDING.md. Don't be surprised if this takes up to three hours to complete, and don't be surprised if you run into errors! If you have any questions or run into any issues, post a message here. I'll be monitoring Slack over the weekend and we can work through them together.

Oh, after that, to prepare for the actual content of our first class, you'll also need to register for an account at PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/account/register/

Good luck! Talk soon, and see you in class!
