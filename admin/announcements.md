## Class 1 Prep

Send this on Friday afternoon the week before the first class:

```
Hey everyone, my name is Mike Rossetti and I'll be your instructor for Unit 3. :wave: Our primary goals for this unit are to transition from notebooks to local development, as well as to ensure our data science efforts are verifiable and reproducible.

In the first sprint, we'll focus on getting more comfortable with local development tools as we develop, test, and release our own Python package. In the second sprint, we'll focus on databases and SQL as an invaluable and foundational skill for any data scientist. Then in the third sprint, we'll build upon the first two sprints by creating a database-backed web application and deploying it to a remote server so anyone can share our data science efforts with the world! Excited? Here we go!

To prepare for the first sprint, you'll want to make sure you are comfortable running local development tools to the greatest extent possible before the first class, so you don't get frustrated or overwhelmed next week. Towards this end I have prepared a Getting Started Guide for you to follow:

FYI - I wouldn't be surprised if this entire process takes you three hours. If you have any questions or run into any issues, post a message here. I'll be monitoring Slack over the weekend and we can work them out together.
